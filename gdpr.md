  Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) cares about privacy and does not unnecessarily process or share your information. P2PU does not sell or give away any user data to third parties.

  When you sign up for a learning circle, your email address and information provided in the signup form will be shared with the facilitator of the learning circle. You should expect to receive at least one email when you sign up, one email per meeting and maybe one or two other emails from your facilitator with extra information and/or a request to provide your feedback on the experience. Additionally, if you opt-in to hearing about future learning opportunities from P2PU, you will receive infrequent emails (4 messages per year or less) from P2PU. 

  If at any point you’d like to withdraw consent, you can do so by following the instructions included in all messages we send you. Alternatively, you can also withdraw consent on [this page](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/optout/).
